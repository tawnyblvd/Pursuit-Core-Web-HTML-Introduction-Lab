    From Wikipedia, the <em>free</em> encyclopedia.

    <p class="match"><strong>A sundial measures time by the position of the sun</strong>. The most commonly seen designs,
       such as<br> the 'ordinary' or standard garden sundial, cast a shadow on a flat surface marked with the hours of<br>
the day. As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by the shadow changes. However,<br>
sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow.<br>
    </p>

    <p class="match">Most sundial designs indicate apparent solar time. Minor design variations can measure standard<br>
       and daylight saving time, as well.

  <h2 style="font-family: 'Linux Libertine','Georgia','Times',serif;">History</h2>

  <p class="match">Sundials in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BC) are <strong>known from ancient<br>
Egypt</strong>, and were developed further by other cultures, including the Chinese, Greek, and Roman<br>
cultures. A type of sundial without gnomon is described in the old Old Testament
(Isaiah 38:2).<br>
  </p>

  <p class="match">The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia (ca. 160 BC-ca. 100 BC) is said to have<br>
invented a universal sundial that could be used anywhere on Earth. The French astronomer Oronce<br>
 Fine constructed a sundial of ivory in 1524. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a<br>
  treatise on the sundial in 1570, in which he included instructions for the manufacture and laying out<br>
   of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Giuseppe Biancani's Construction instrumenti ad horologia<br>
    solaria discusses how to make a perfect sundial, with accompanying illustrations.<br>
  </p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Linux Libertine','Georgia','Times',serif;">Installation of standard sundials</h2>
  <p class="match">Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. By tilting such a sundial, it<br>
 may be installed so that it will keep time. However, some mass-produced garden sundials<br> are inaccurate because of poor design and cannot be corrected.
